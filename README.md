Implementation draft to transform json files such as xslt

Need to define a json file for the transformation with those attributes:

key -> the value after transformation

Inside the key
   source : The source from the source file. To get inside the tree concat path with ":" before xpath implementation. Write the number element for array
   value : A value to be applied fix one
   format : A function to apply
   type : For changing type needs

To use the format add_function should be called from the Transformer object

From the transformer object transform() will transform the json withing the transformer file
